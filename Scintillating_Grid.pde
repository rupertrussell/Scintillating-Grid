// The scintillating grid illusion is an optical illusion, discovered by E. and B. Lingelbach and M. Schrauf in 1994.
// [2] It is often considered a variation of the Hermann grid illusion but posesses different properties.[2][3]

// It is constructed by superimposing white discs on the intersections of orthogonal gray bars on a black background. 
// Dark dots seem to appear and disappear rapidly at random intersections, hence the label "scintillating". 
// When a person keeps his or her eyes directly on a single intersection, the dark dot does not appear. 
// The dark dots disappear if one is too close to or too far from the image.
